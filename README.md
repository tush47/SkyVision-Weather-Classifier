This model can classify what weather is there in the provided image. It has 97 percent test accuracy but approx 80 percent validation accuracy due to the lack of computation power during training.

You can use it by simply uploading the image file and renaming the current input image provided. It can be deployed in a huge model where weather detection is important like for self driving car. That's it . Enjoy
